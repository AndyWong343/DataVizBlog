    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Introduction\r\nOne year on, the COVID-19 pandemic continues raging and is still very much on everyone’s mind. 2021 started with a faint glimmer of hope as vaccinations begin to roll out across the world. Countries that have access to the various vaccines are doing their best to fight against a current of anti-vaccine sentiment. While many people are hopeful that the vaccine will finally bring the pandemic under control, many others are wary of the potential dangers of being inoculated with a vaccine so new that any potential long-term side effects have yet to be uncovered. Compounding this fear is the fact that many of these vaccines were pushed through approval processes at lightning speed, causing people to question if the proper processes and due diligence were maintained.\r\nYouGov, together with Imperial College London, conducts an ongoing survey to gather data on people’s behaviours in response to COVID-19. This blog uses the publicly available data and focuses on people’s sentiments to the COVID-19 vaccines in particular. The scope of this visualisation is for survey responses from January 2021.\r\n1.1 The Scene\r\nA research team is currently conducting a study to understand public sentiment regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. Below are two data visualisations created by one of the research scientists.\r\n1.2 The Task\r\nCritique the graph for both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three observations from each evaluation criterion. (15 marks)\r\nWith reference to the critique above, suggest an alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design is trying to overcome. (15 marks)\r\nUsing Tableau, design your proposed data visualisation. (25 marks)\r\nProvided step-by-step descriptions on how the data visualisation was prepared. (30 marks)\r\nDescribe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared. (15 marks)\r\nThe remade data visualisation can be viewed on Tableau Public.\r\n2.0 Makeover\r\n2.1 Critique of the visualisation, and suggested improvements\r\n2.1.1 Clarity\r\nS/n\r\nCritique\r\nSuggestions for improvement\r\n1\r\nThe graphs do not show the confidence intervals of the responses. This does not provide a good sense of how reliable the survey scores are. A better sense of the variability and reliability of the survey responses can be given if a confidence interval were presented in the visualisation.\r\nInclude the confidence interval of the survey scores for a more holistic and reliable presentation of the survey results.\r\n2\r\nThe visualisation is one-dimensional and too simplistic.a) It does not take into account demographic data such as gender, age, employment status, and household constitution. The data presented is too broad and simplistic for useful sense-making.b) It only presents data from one single survey question, which does not provide sufficient context to the responses and sentiment of the respondents. To have a fuller understanding of public sentiment, other relevant survey questions should be included.\r\nIntroduce more dimensions into the visualisation.a) Include demographic profiles into the visualisation for a more nuanced presentation of the data.b) Introduce other relevant survey questions for a deeper and fuller understanding of the data.\r\n3\r\nThe stacked bar chart can more accurately reflect what the survey responses are. While the stacked bars show the proportion of responses according to the survey score, it does not clearly show the positive- or negative-leaning of the responses to each survey question. It would be useful to know the public’s general leaning in response to the various questions.\r\nRedesign the stacked bar chart to show the general consensus of the responses in a more visually intuitive way.\r\n2.1.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/n\r\nCritique\r\nSuggestions for improvement\r\n1\r\nThe colour scheme for the right-hand chart does not corroborate to the usual meaning of the colours. Red typically has the opposite meaning of blue, and so if blue is 1, red should be 5.\r\nImprove the colour scheme of the chart to be more intuitive.\r\n2\r\nThe right-hand chart does not add much more value to the visualisation other than to sort the countries in descending order of responses to survey score 1. This is too broad a generalisation for the visualisation to offer any meaningful insight other than the countries that are more ‘pro-vaccine’ based on score 1.\r\nRedesign the right-hand chart entirely to provide more insight to the data. This could include any of the suggestions for improvement discussed in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.\r\n3\r\nLack of editing and proofreading of the title of the graph. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, although not critical in themselves, distract from that which is critical: the main content and message of the visualisations. In the left-hand chart, ‘vaccine’ was spelt as ‘vacinne’.\r\nEnsure proper editing and proofreading of the content (eg. ‘vaccine’, not ‘vacinne’) to enhance the overall presentation and bring focus to the critical message of the visualisation. The names of the countries could also be shown to their proper format (‘United Kingdom’ instead of ‘united-kingdom’), and capitalised.\r\nBased on the above assessment, the chart falls across Quadrants I and IV of the matrix:  \r\n2.2 Sketch an alternative visualisation\r\n \r\nThe proposed visualisation above offers comparison with a country, as well as across countries. This will provide a better comparison of public sentiment across regions, for each survey question.\r\nThe visualisation will allow for customisation of demographic data for more nuanced visualisation, depending on the user’s scope of interest.\r\nA confidence interval will be shown in the visualisation (right-hand chart) to allow for more accurate understanding of the survey responses.\r\nThe colours of the left-hand chart will be adjusted to be more intuitive.\r\n2.3 Build the proposed visualisation\r\n2.3.1 Import the data\r\nStep 1: Open Tableau. Add in any one of the data files as the data source. \r\nStep 2: Remove the table as the dataset. \r\nStep 3: Double-click on “New Union”, multi-select all the country csv files and drag them into the Union dialogue under “Specific (manual).  Click OK. This will union all the tables into one single dataset.\r\n2.3.2 Clean the data\r\nEndtime column Step 4: The “endtime” column will be used to ascertain the date of the survey response.First, change the data type to string. \r\nStep 5: Click on Custom Split. \r\nStep 6: Type a space into “Use the separator” field to split by space.Click OK. \r\nStep 7: “endtime – Split 1” is created. \r\nStep 8: Change data type to Date. \r\nStep 9: Rename as “Endtime” for spelling consistency. \r\nStep 10: Click on the column that is not needed and click Hide. \r\nEmployment status merged column Step 11: Click on Manage metadata. \r\nKeep only the relevant columns:endtime Split-1household_childrenagegenderhousehold_sizeemployment_statusemployment_status_1employment_status_2employment_status_3employment_status_4employment_status_5employment_status_6employment_status_7Table Name.\r\nSome countries saved employment_status data as Boolean type. This is mismatched from other countries that did not. As such, these columns needs to be merged into one single column to aid the building of the visualization.\r\nStep 12: Create a calculated field as shown. \r\nStep 13: Ensure data type is String. \r\nStep 14: Rename the column. \r\nHousehold children recoded column Step 15: Create a calculated field for household_children to remove null values. \r\nStep 16: Rename column. \r\nStep 17: Ensure data type is integer. \r\nHousehold size recoded column Step 18: Create a calculated field for household_size to remove null values. \r\nStep 19: Ensure data type is integer. \r\nStep 20: Rename column. \r\nSurvey Question and Survey Response (INT) columns Step 21: Pivot all survey responses to make the table long and narrow. \r\nStep 22: Edit the aliases of all the survey questions for clarity. \r\nStep 23: Ensure data type for Survey Question is String. \r\nStep 24: Rename column. \r\nStep 25: Split the Survey responses to retain only the number. \r\nStep 26: Change the data type to integer. \r\nCountry column Step 27: Change the country names to the proper spelling. \r\nStep 28: Ensure data type is String, and Geographic Role is Country/Region. \r\nStep 29: Rename the field as “Country”. \r\nAge column Step 30: Ensure data type is integer. \r\nStep 31: Rename column for consistency. \r\nGender column Step 32: Ensure “gender” column is String type. \r\nStep 33: Rename column for consistency. \r\nSaving a new data set Step 34: Open a new Sheet and click View Data. \r\nStep 35: Click on Export All and save data file as COVID_survey.csv. This will save only the cleaned fields and remove the hidden fields, thereby having a smaller dataset to use, for improved efficiency. \r\n2.3.3 Creating the calculated fields\r\nCount Negative field The Count Negative field orientates the centre of the neutral survey responses to 0, so that the Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree can be presented in a visually more intuitive way.\r\nStep 36: Create a calculated field named Count Negative. \r\nGantt Start field The Gantt Start field defines the starting point of the stacked bar chart.\r\nStep 37: Create a calculated field named Gantt Start. \r\nGantt Percent field The Gantt Percent field defines the length of each portion of the stacked bar chart.\r\nStep 38: Create a calculated field named Gantt Percent. \r\nNumber of Records field The Number of Records field counts the number of records in the dataset.\r\nStep 39: Create a calculated field named Number of Records. \r\nPercentage field The Percentage field converts the count of the entries to a percentage.\r\nStep 40: Create a calculated field named Percentage. \r\nStrongly Agree and Agree Scores field The Strongly Agree and Agree Scores field counts the number of Strongly Agree (1) and Agree (2) survey scores.\r\nStep 41: Create a calculated field named Strongly Agree and Agree Scores. \r\nTotal Count field The Total Count field totals up the number of entries for each response.\r\nStep 42: Create a calculated field named Total Count. \r\nTotal Count Negative field The Total Count Negative field totals up the numbers given in the Count Negative field.\r\nStep 43: Create a calculated field named Total Count Negative. \r\nProportion field The Proportion field calculates the proportion of Strongly Agree and Agee Scores column against the total number of records.\r\nStep 44: Create a calculated field named Proportion column. \r\nProp_SE field The Prop_SE field calculates the standard error of the Proportion field. This will be used to calculate the confidence interval of the survey responses.\r\nStep 45: Create a calculated field named Prop_SE. \r\nZ_95% field The Z_95% field calculates Z-score for the 95% confidence interval, to be used later.\r\nStep 46: Create a calculated field named Z_95%. \r\nProp_Margin of Error 95% field The Prop_Margin of Error 95% field calculates standard error for a Z-score of 95%. This will be used later.\r\nStep 47: Create a calculated field named Prop_Margin of Error 95%. \r\nProp_Lower Limit 95% field The Prop_Lower Limit 95% field calculates the lower limit of the standard error at a 95% confidence interval.\r\nStep 48: Create a calculated field named Prop_Lower Limit 95%. \r\nProp_Upper Limit 95% field The Prop_Upper Limit 95% field calculates the upper limit of the standard error at a 95% confidence interval.\r\nStep 49: Create a calculated field named Prop_Upper Limit 95%. \r\n2.3.3 Create the worksheet (Comparison within country)\r\nStep 50: Drag Endtime to the Filters Pane and filter to January 2021, since the scope of this visualisation is only for that month.\r\nStep 51: Right-click on Endtime and select January 2021.

This can be seen from the longer bars for Strongly Agree (blue bar) and Agree (teal bar) vis-a-vis Strongly Disagree (red bar) and Disagree (pink bar), indicating a higher proportion of responses to Strongly Agree and Agree. See sample below.\r\nObservation 2: Females are generally more concerned about contracting COVID-19 than males.\r\nThis pertains to survey question Vac 2-1. All countries except Singapore show that, at a confidence interval of 95%, the female population (orange line) are more concerned about contracting the coronavirus compared to males (blue line).\r\nObservation 3: Older people, typically males, are generally less concerned about the side-effects of a vaccine.\r\nThis pertains to survey question Vac 2-2. Across all countries, respondents aged 65 to 99 years indicate that they are less concerned about the side-effects of a vaccine, compared to younger people (18 to 64 years old).\r\nFrom the visualisation below, we can see that respondents in the 65 to 99 year age group have longer 95% confidence interval lines compared to across all age groups. This could be because there are comparatively less respondents from this particular age group. Males in this age category tend to be less concerned about side effects than females. \r\nAppendix\r\nThe survey questions used in this visualisation are as follows.\r\nCode\r\nQuestion\r\nVac 1\r\nIf a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.\r\nVac 2-1\r\nI am worried about getting COVID-19.\r\nVac 2-2\r\nI am worried about potential side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine.\r\nVac 2-3\r\nI believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID-19 vaccine.\r\nVac 2-6\r\nIf I do not get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it.\r\nVac 3\r\nIf a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to me a year from now, I definitely intend to get it.\r\nThanks for visiting my blog!\r\nThis post is a data visualisation assignment for the MITB programme at the Singapore Management University.

Font styles and colour schemes are easy on the eyes.\r\nHowever, the presentation of the data itself could be clearer.\r\nBased on this assessment, the chart falls into Quadrant IV of the matrix:\r\nSource of clarity vs aesthetics matrix: https://dataremixed.com/2012/05/data-visualization-clarity-or-aesthetics2.0 Makeover\r\n2.1 Critique of the visualisation, and suggested improvements\r\n2.1.1 Clarity\r\nS/n\r\nCritique\r\nSuggestions for improvement\r\n1\r\nUnclear subtitle. It is not clear what the subtitle “Per Cent” refers to. It almost looks to be put there as an afterthought.\r\nRemove the subtitle and label the appropriate axis with “%”. This will eliminate uncessary text, yet present the percentage values in a more intuitive manner.\r\n2\r\nThe x-axis is not explained. There are no labels to explain what the three types of values on the x-axis mean.\r\nPivot the data such that the percentages are on the x-axis and the age group is on the y-axis, and label the axes accordingly. This will improve the clarity of the visualisation.\r\n3\r\nAge Group is not presented clearly. Compounded with the blue and grey lines of the line graph, it looked as though a timeline was being presented. Only upon further examination was it understood to be a presentation of the proportion of age group in percentage.\r\nPivot the data such that age group is presented on the y-axis. This will improve the intuitiveness of the visualisation.\r\n4\r\nDuplicate presentation of information. The two lines of the line graph essentially present the same information as the percentage values in the x-axis. The line graph presents the trend visually, while the x-axis provides the actual percentage values. This duplication would not be needed with better visualization design.\r\nRemove the June 2009 and June 2019 percentage values from the x-axis. This will no longer be necessary once the data is presented appropriately.\r\n2.1.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/n\r\nCritique\r\nSuggestions for improvement\r\n1\r\nGood use of colour to differentiate the two time periods. A more contrasting colour scheme might be better.\r\nUse more appealing colours to enhance the contrast and clarity of the two sets of data being compared.\r\n2\r\nClear labeling of what the two lines in the line graph represent, and the median ages. However, better designed aesthetics could allow for more concise labeling (using less words).\r\nInclude labels as necessary to improve conciseness and clarity.\r\n3\r\nWith thee different values, the x-axis is too cluttered.\r\nThis will be solved once the data is pivoted appropriately, as mentioned in section 2.1.1.\r\n4\r\nA minor point: although best practice states that number ranges should start from 0, there is no need for the age group to start from 0 in this case, as this graph is meant to present the labour force which consists of only persons aged 15 years and over. The age groups presented covers the entire range of legal working age ranges.\r\nNo action necessary.\r\n2.2 Sketch of the alternative visualisation\r\nThe sketch below is the proposed improved visualisation to address the critique presented in section 2.1.\r\nProposed visualisation2.3 Building the visualisation\r\nThis visualisation was built using Tableau Desktop Professional Edition 2020.4.0.\r\nStep 1. Import data into TableauImport Excel file into Tableau.Step 2. The data is not standardised and cleaned because the formatting of the spreadsheet is not friendly for data importation.Step 3. Clean the dataClick on the “Cleaned with Data Interpreter” to provide an initial clean-up of the data to allow for easier manual cleaning.Step 4. Hide uneccessary columnsHide the left-most column as it is not useful for this analysis.Step 5. Rename columnsRename the “Age (Years) 1” column to “Age Group” for clarity.Step 6. Check data type Age columnCheck that the “Age” column is of the correct data type (String).Step 7. Check data type of year columnsCheck that the rest of the year columns are of the correct data type (Number[decimal]).Step 8. Define Column and Row dataDrag “2009” and “2019” to the Columns pane and “Age Group” to the Rows pane.Step 9. Exclude irrelevant columnsExclude the “NULL” and “Total” columns from the chart as these are not useful for the analysis.  Step 10. Exclude overlapping age groupExclude the overlapping age groups, as these will confuse the data presented in the visualisation.Step 11. Sort Age GroupSort “Age Group” in descending order.  Step 12. Superimpose the two chartsSelect “Dual Axis” to combine the two charts into one.Step 13. Synchronise the two y-axesSelect “Synchronise Axis” to ensure both charts’ y-axes match.Step 14. Remove headerRemove “Show Header” to show only one y-axis.Step 15. Change visualisation for 2019 chartChange the 2019 Mark to Bar chart.Step 16. Reorder 2019 and 2009 chartsSwap “SUM(2019)” to the front of the Columns pane to display the 2019 chart behind the 2009 chart.Step 17. Show whole range of x-axisEdit the range of the x-axis to show the whole range of 0% to 100%. Rename label as “LFPR (%)”.Step 18. Expand chart viewChange the view to “Entire View” for visual clarity.Step 19. Edit chart titleStep 20. Edit Legend titleEdit the Legend title to “Year”.Step 21. Rename the SheetStep 22. Completed visualisationThe completed chart looks like this:\r\n2.4 Key observations from the visualisation\r\nS/n\r\nObservation\r\n1\r\nThe largest increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 was among the 50 to 64, and 65 to 69 age groups. This kind of shift in LFPR was to be expected of an ageing population as more older workers joined the workforce than their younger counterparts.\r\n2\r\nThe 25 to 29 age group had the highest LFPR in 2009. Ten years later in 2019, the age group with the highest LFPR was 30 to 34, which was one age group younger than the original 25 to 29 age group. The showed that from 2009 to 2019, the age group with the highest LFPR moved down by one group. The reason for this trend is outside the scope of this analysis but is a potential area of interest for further study.\r\n3\r\nOf all the age groups, only the 20 to 24 age group declined in LFPR from 2009 to 2019. This was the only exception among all the age groups. As this was typically the age group of university undergraduates, it may have signified that more people in this age group were attending university. However, this point warrants further study.\r\n4\r\nOverall, the lower the age group, the slower the increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019, with the exception of the 15 to 19 age group, which seemed to reverse the trend compared to the next older age group (20 to 24). This seemed to contradict Singapore’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) which has been declining consistently, but may have been bolstered by the slight up-tick in TFR in 2000.\r\nThanks for visiting my blog!\r\nThis post is a data visualisation assignment for the MITB programme at the Singapore Management University.
