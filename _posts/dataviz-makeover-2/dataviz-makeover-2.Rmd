# 1.0 Introduction
One year on, the COVID-19 pandemic continues raging and is still very much on everyone’s mind. 2021 started with a faint glimmer of hope as vaccinations begin to roll out across the world. Countries that have access to the various vaccines are doing their best to fight against a current of anti-vaccine sentiment. While many people are hopeful that the vaccine will finally bring the pandemic under control, many others are wary of the potential dangers of being inoculated with a vaccine so new that any potential long-term side effects have yet to be uncovered. Compounding this fear is the fact that many of these vaccines were pushed through approval processes at lightning speed, causing people to question if the proper processes and due diligence were maintained.

[YouGov, together with Imperial College London](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/04/11/covid-19-how-yougov-partnership-imperial-college-), conducts an ongoing survey to gather data on people’s behaviours in response to COVID-19. This blog uses the publicly available data and focuses on people’s sentiments to the COVID-19 vaccines in particular, within January 2021.

## 1.1 The Scene
A research team is currently conducting a study to understand public sentiment regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. Below are two data visualisations created by one of the research scientists.![](images/originalchart.jpg){width=100%}

## 1.2 The Task
1.	Critique the graph for both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three observations from each evaluation criterion. (15 marks)
2.	With reference to the critique above, suggest an alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design is trying to overcome. (15 marks)
3.	Using Tableau, design your proposed data visualisation. (25 marks)
4.	Provided step-by-step descriptions on how the data visualisation was prepared. (30 marks)
5.	Describe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared. (15 marks)

The remade data visualisation can be viewed on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andywong#!/vizhome/DataVizMakeover2_16136143601240/PublicsentimenttowardaCOVID-19vaccine).

# 2.0 Makeover
## 2.1 Critique of the visualisation, and suggested improvements
### **2.1.1 Clarity**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | _The graphs do not show the confidence intervals of the responses._ This does not provide a good sense of how reliable the survey score is. A better sense of the variability and reliability of the survey response can be offered if a confidence interval were present in the visualisation. | _Include a confidence interval_ for a more accurate and reliable presentation of the survey results.
2 | _The visualisation is one-dimensional and too simplistic._</br></br>a) It does not take into account demographic data such as gender, age, employment status, and household constitution. This makes the graph too general and simplistic for useful sense-making.</br></br>b) It only presents data from one single survey question, which does not provide sufficient context to the responses and therefore sentiment of the respondents. To have a fuller understanding of public sentiment to the vaccine, other relevant questions should be included. | _Introduce more dimensions to the visualisation._</br></br>a) Include demographic profiles into the visualisation for a more nuanced presentation of the data.</br></br>b) Introduce other relevant survey questions for a deeper and fuller understanding of the data.
3 | _The stacked bar chart can more accurately reflect what the survey responses are._ While the stacked bars show the proportion of responses according to the survey score, it does not visually show the positive- or negative-leaning of the general sentiment. This would be useful to know the public's sentiment to certain survey questions. | _Redesign the stacked bar chart_ to show the general consensus of the responses in a more visually intuitive way.

### **2.1.2 Aesthetics**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | _The colour scheme for the right-hand chart does not corroborate to the usual meaning of the colours._ Red typically has the opposite meaning of blue, and so if blue is 1, red should be 5 and not 3. | _Improve the colour scheme_ of the chart to be more intuitive.
2 | _The right-hand chart does not add much more value to the visualisation_ other than sorting the countries in descending order of responses to survey score 1. This is too broad a generalisation for the visualisation to offer any meaningful insight other than the countries that are more 'pro-vaccine' based on score 1. | _Redesign the right-hand chart entirely_ for better presentation of the data.
3 | _Lack of editing and proofreading of the title_. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, although not critical in themselves, distract from that which is critical: the main content and message of the visualisations. | _Ensure proper editing and proofreading of the content_ (eg. 'vaccine', not 'vacinne') to enhance the overall presentation and bring focus to the critical message of the visualisation. The names of the countries could also be shown to their proper format ('United Kingdom' instead of 'united-kingdom'), and capitalised.

Based on the above assessment, the chart falls across Quadrants I and IV of the matrix:
</br>
![](images/quadrant.jpg){width=100%}

## 2.2 Sketch an alternative visualisation
</br>
![](images/sketch.jpg){width=100%}

The proposed visualisation as sketched out offers comparison with a country, as well as across countries. This will provide a better comparison of public sentiment for each survey question.

The visualisation will also allow for customisation of demographic data for more nuanced visualisation, depending on the user's scope of interest.

A confidence interval will also be shown (in the right-hand chart), to allow for more accurate understanding of the survey responses.

The colours of the left-hand chart will also be adjusted to be more intuitive.

## 2.3 Build the visualisation

### 2.3.1 Import the data
Step 1: Open Tableau. Add in any one of the data files as the data source.
![](images/opendatafile.jpg){width=100%}

Step 2: Remove the table as the dataset.</br>
![](images/removedataset.jpg){width=60%}

Step 3: Double-click on “New Union”, multi-select all the country csv files and drag them into the Union dialogue under “Specific (manual).</br>
![](images/union.jpg){width=75%}</br>
Click OK. This will union all the tables into one single dataset.

### 2.3.2 Clean the data
**Endtime column**</br>
Step 4: The “endtime” column will be used to ascertain the date of the survey response.</br>First, change the data type to string.</br>
![](images/endtimecol1.jpg){width=40%}

Step 5: Click on Custom Split.</br>
![](images/endtimecol2.jpg){width=40%}

Step 6: Type a space into “Use the separator” field to split by space.</br>Click OK.</br>
![](images/endtimecol3.jpg){width=50%}

Step 7: “endtime – Split 1” is created.</br>
![](images/endtimecol4.jpg){width=30%}

Step 8: Change data type to Date.</br>
![](images/endtimecol5.jpg){width=30%}

Step 9: Rename as “Endtime” for spelling consistency.</br>
![](images/endtimecol6.jpg){width=30%}

Step 10: Click on the column that is not needed and click Hide.</br>
![](images/endtimecol7.jpg){width=50%}

**Employment status merged column**</br>
Step 11: Click on Manage metadata.</br>
![](images/employstatus1.jpg){width=70%}

Keep only the relevant columns:</br>_endtime Split-1_</br>_household_children_</br>_age_</br>_gender_</br>_household_size_</br>_employment_status_</br>_employment_status_1_</br>_employment_status_2_</br>_employment_status_3_</br>_employment_status_4_</br>_employment_status_5_</br>_employment_status_6_</br>_employment_status_7_</br>_Table Name_.

Some countries saved _employment_status_ data as Boolean type. This is mismatched from other countries that did not. As such, these columns needs to be merged into one single column to aid the building of the visualization.

Step 12: Create a calculated field as shown.</br>
![](images/employstatus2.jpg){width=100%}

Step 13: Ensure data type is String.</br>
![](images/employstatus3.jpg){width=30%}

Step 14: Rename the column.</br>
![](images/employstatus4.jpg){width=50%}


**Household children recoded column**</br>
Step 15: Create a calculated field for household_children to remove null values.
![](images/householdchild1.jpg){width=100%}

Step 16: Rename column.</br>
![](images/householdchild2.jpg){width=40%}

Step 17: Ensure data type is integer.</br>
![](images/householdchild3.jpg){width=40%}

**Household size recoded column**</br>
Step 18: Create a calculated field for household_size to remove null values.</br>
![](images/householdsize1.jpg){width=100%}

Step 19: Ensure data type is integer.</br>
![](images/householdsize2.jpg){width=40%}

Step 20: Rename column.</br>
![](images/householdsize3.jpg){width=40%}

**Survey Question and Survey Response (INT) columns**</br>
Step 21: Pivot all survey responses to make the table long and narrow.</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse1.jpg){width=100%}

Step 22: Edit the aliases of all the survey questions for clarity.</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse2.jpg){width=50%}</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse3.jpg){width=100%}

Step 23: Ensure data type for Survey Question is String.</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse4.jpg){width=40%}

Step 24: Rename column.</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse5.jpg){width=30%}

Step 25: Split the Survey responses to retain only the number.</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse6.jpg){width=40%}</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse7.jpg){width=40%}

Step 26: Change the data type to integer.</br>
![](images/surveyquestionresponse8.jpg){width=30%}

**Country column**</br>
Step 27: Change the country names to the proper spelling.</br>
![](images/country1.jpg){width=40%}</br>
![](images/country2.jpg){width=100%}

Step 28: Ensure data type is String, and Geographic Role is Country/Region.</br>
![](images/country3.jpg){width=40%}

Step 29: Rename the field as “Country”.</br>
![](images/country4.jpg){width=30%}

**Age column**</br>
Step 30: Ensure data type is integer.</br>
![](images/age1.jpg){width=30%}

Step 31: Rename column for consistency.</br>
![](images/age2.jpg){width=30%}

**Gender column**</br>
Step 32: Ensure “gender” column is String type.</br>
![](images/gender1.jpg){width=30%}

Step 33: Rename column for consistency.</br>
![](images/gender2.jpg){width=30%}

**Saving a new data set**</br>
Step 34: Open a new Sheet and click View Data.</br>
![](images/savenewdataset1.jpg){width=100%}

Step 35: Click on Export All and save data file as COVID_survey.csv. This will save only the cleaned fields and remove the hidden fields, thereby having a smaller dataset to use, for improved efficiency.</br>
![](images/savenewdataset2.jpg){width=100%}

### 2.3.3 Creating the calculated fields
**Count Negative field**</br>

Step 43: Create a calculated field named Total Count Negative.</br>
![](images/totalcountnegative.jpg){width=100%}

**Proportion field**</br>
The Proportion field calculates the proportion of Strongly Agree and Agee Scores column against the total number of records.

Step 44: Create a calculated field named Proportion column.</br>
![](images/proportion.jpg){width=100%}


**Prop_SE field**</br>
The Prop_SE field calculates the standard error of the Proportion field. This will be used to calculate the confidence interval of the survey responses.

Step 45: Create a calculated field named Prop_SE.</br>
![](images/propse.jpg){width=100%}

**Z_95% field**</br>
The Z_95% field calculates Z-score for the 95% confidence interval, to be used later.

![](images/z95.jpg){width=100%}

**Prop_Margin of Error 95% field**</br>
The Prop_Margin of Error 95% field calculates standard error for a Z-score of 95%. This will be used later.

Step 47: Create a calculated field named Prop_Margin of Error 95%.</br>
![](images/propmarginoferror95.jpg){width=100%}

**Prop_Lower Limit 95% field**</br>
The Prop_Lower Limit 95% field calculates the lower limit of the standard error at a 95% confidence interval.

Step 48: Create a calculated field named Prop_Lower Limit 95%.</br>
![](images/proplowerlimit95.jpg){width=100%}

**Prop_Upper Limit 95% field**</br>
The Prop_Upper Limit 95% field calculates the upper limit of the standard error at a 95% confidence interval.

# 3.0 Insights from the new visualisation

### Observation 1: People are generally open to being vaccinated against COVID-19.
This pertains to survey questions _Vac 1_, _Vac 2-3_, _Vac 2-6_, and _Vac 3_.

Overall, there is an openness to being vaccinated against COVID-19 across all countries. This can be seen from the longer bars for Strongly Agree (blue bar) and Agree (teal bar) vis-a-vis Strongly Disagree (red bar) and Disagree (pink bar), indicating a higher proportion of responses to Strongly Agree and Agree. See sample below.</br></br>![](images/observationcontracingcovid.jpg){width=75%}

### Observation 2: Females are generally more concerned about contracting COVID-19 than males.
This pertains to survey question _Vac 2-1_. All countries except Singapore show that, at a confidence interval of 95%, the female population (orange line) are more concerned about contracting the coronavirus compared to males (blue line).</br>![](images/observationcontracingcovid.jpg){width=75%}

### Observation 3: Older people are generally less concerned about the side-effects of a vaccine.
This pertains to survey question _Vac 2-2_. Across all countries, respondents aged 65 to 99 years indicate that they are less concerned about the side-effects of a vaccine...</br>![](images/sideeffects65andabove.jpg){width=75%}</br>...compared to younger people (18 to 64 years old).</br>![](images/sideeffects18to64.jpg){width=75%}

From the visualisation, we can see that this age group of respondents has longer 95% confidence interval lines, compared to across all age groups. This could be because there are comparatively less respondents from this age group. Females in this age category tend to be more concerned about side effects than males. </br>![](images/cifor65andabove.jpg){width=75%}</br>

# Appendix

The survey questions used in this visualisation are as follows.

Code | Question
-- | -------------
Vac 1 | If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.
Vac 2-1 | I am worried about getting COVID-19.
Vac 2-2 | I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Vac 2-3 | I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Vac 2-6 | If I do not get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it.
Vac 3 | If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to me a year from now, I definitely intend to get it.
