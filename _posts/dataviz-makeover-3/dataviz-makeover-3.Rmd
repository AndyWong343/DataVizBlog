# 1.0 Introduction
On 1 February 2021, the world woke up to news of a coup in Myanmar. The ensuing political violence and the societal harm and economic damage that armed conflict leaves in its wake was once again brought to the fore. Innocent lives were ended and economic activity virtually brought to a standstill.

In light of these developments, this dashboard visualises armed conflict in Southeast Asia from 2010 to 2020, with the objective of surfacing the most common and deadliest types of conflict.

This visualisation makes use of data provided by [The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard).

## 1.1 The Scene
This is a visualisation created to reveal the saptio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in selected Southeast Asian countries between 2015 to 2020. ![](images/assignmentgraph.png){width=100%}

## 1.2 The Task
1.	Critique the graph for its clarity, aesthetics and interactivity. At least two observations from each evaluation criterion.
2.	With reference to the critique above, suggest an alternative data visualisation and interactive techniques to improve the current design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternatives design attempts to overcome.
3.	Using Tableau, design your proposed data visualisation.
4.	Provided step-by-step descriptions on how the data visualisation was prepared.
5.	Describe five major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.

The remade data visualisation can be viewed on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andywong#!/vizhome/DataVizMakeover3ArmedconflictinSoutheastAsia/GeolocationofarmedconflictinSoutheastAsia).

# 2.0 Makeover
## 2.1 Critique of the visualisation, and suggested improvements
### **2.1.1 Clarity**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | The visualisation is clear in presenting the event types (types of conflict). It also allows the user to select which country to focus on. However, this is very limited information and _does not show any other information that might be useful in such analysis._ | _Allow the user to drill down into deeper information_ such as event sub types and number of fatalities specific to each region within a country.
2 | The visualisation presents a broad overview such as the trend of number of event types from 2015 to 2020 _but does not allow the user to drill into specific years or months._ Therefore, the date of each conflict cannot be identified. This does not provide much useful information for analysis. | _Allow the user to be able to view exact years and months in the visualisation._

### **2.1.2 Aesthetics**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | _The dots in the map do not provide any further information other than the location of the event._ | _Adjust the size of the dots to represent the number of fatalities._
2 | _The labels in the line graph are superfluous._ If removed, the size of the graph can be increased for better ease of viewing. | _Remove the labels in the line graph_ and use colours represent instead.

### **2.1.3 Interactivity**
S/n | Critique | Suggestions for improvement
- | ------ | ------
1 | The visualisation _does not allow selection of specific months or years for deeper analysis._ This limits the usability of the visualisation. | _Include an interactive feature that allows the user to select a specific month and year to focus in to._
2 | The visualisation _does not allow the user to select more than one country at a time._ Such features might be useful to the user for comparison and analysis. | Include a feature to _allow the user to select more than one country at a time._



## 2.2 Sketch of proposed alternative visualisation
</br>
![](images/sketch.png){width=100%}

The proposed visualisation above provides more in-depth analysis such as the proportion of each event type and sub type, as well as a comparison of the number of fatalities of each event type.

The visualisation allows the user to select the specific month and year for more focused analysis.

the visualisation allows the user to select more than one country, for more useful analysis. The treemap of sub event types also allows for this same feature of selecting multiple sub event types for analysis, instead of only a single type.

The visualisation will make use of colour to replace labels, allowing for more intuitive associations, as well as to free up more space to allow the charts to be larger.

## 2.3 Build the visualisation

### 2.3.1 Importing the data
**Step 1**: Connect to the data set.
![](images/importdata.png){width=100%}

Ensure data types are correct.</br>
**Step 2**: Change _Region_ to _Country/Region_ type.
![](images/regiontocountryregiontype.png){width=100%}

**Step 3**: Change _Admin1_ to _State/Province_ type.
![](images/admin1tostateprovincetype.png){width=100%}

**Step 3**: Change _Admin2_ to _County_ type.
![](images/admin2tocountytype.png){width=100%}

**Step 4**: Change _Admin3_ to _City_ type.

# 3.0 Insights from the new visualisation

### Observation 1: Across the 11 years, violence against civilians caused the most number of fatalities
This is even more fatalities than battles between armed and organised actors. This immediately raises a concern that the ordinary civilians seem to be at higher risk of losing their lives amongst all types of violence.
![](images/observation1-1.png){width=100%}

From the year-on-year trend of conflict types, it can be seen that there was a large spike in the number of fatalities in 2016. Upon closer examination, this seems to have been contributed in large from the Philippines. HOwever, we should also take into consideration that data from the Philippines prior to 2016 is not available in this data set.
![](images/observation1-2.png){width=100%}

If any solace can be found, it is in the fact that all conflict types have generally been on the decline.

### Observation 2: Myanmar has a regular cycle of battles
This can be seen from the year-on-year chart which shows that there were peaks in the number of fatalities resulting from battles in 2011, 2015, and 2019. This seems to coincide with the dissolution of the military junta in 2011, the elections in 2015, and fighting between the Myanmar army and the ethnic Rakhine-backed Arakan army in 2019. It is noteworthy that this seems to be a 4-year cycle.

### Observation 3: Most of the fatalities in The Philippines were due to violence against civilians
The Philippines had the highest number of fatalities among all Southeast Asian countries from 2010 to 2020, as can be seen from the deeper red hue on the map.![](images/observation3-1.png){width=100%}

Focusing in to The Philippines, the bar chart shows that from 2016 to 2020, the highest number of fatalities are due to violence against civilians.
![](images/observation3-2.png){width=100%}

The pie chart corroborates this as it shows that the most common conflict type was violence against civilians.
![](images/observation3-3.png){width=100%}

The treemap shows that attacks were the most common conflict sub-type, accounting for almost 60% of all conflict sub-types. Attacks are defined in the ACLED codebook(https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2019/01/ACLED_Codebook_2019FINAL.docx.pdf) as "when civilians are targeted with any violence by an organised armed actor".
![](images/observation3-4.png){width=100%}

### Observation 4: The Philippines accounts for the most battles in 2017
Turning our focus to the next conflict type that accounts for the most fatalities - battles - the year with the most number of battles was 2017. Zooming into 2017, we see that The Philippines accounts for the most number of battles in that year.
![](images/observation4-1.png){width=100%}

Focusing in on The Philippines, the battle with the most fatalities for that year was in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Lanao del Sur, Marawi - with 1,192 fatalities.
![](images/observation4-2.png){width=100%}

Even so, violence against civilians still 'topped the charts' in terms of number of events, and number of fatalities, corroborating with obervation 1.

### Observation 5: Protests are the least deadly conflict type.
Protests make up almost 30% of all conflict types from 2010-2020, but accounts for only 108 fatalities. The most fatalities coming from a conflict in Dien Bein, Moung Nhe, Viet Nam.
![](images/observation5-1.png){width=100%}

From this, we can see that protests are the least deadly in terms of fatalities. But contrast this with violence against civilians which has the highest number of fatalities, we can reach the conclusion that civilians involved in armed conflict can be vulnerable to violence but can safely partake in peaceful protests. This may advise how civilians and rights groups can strategise their activities to make their voice heard in the safest way possible.
