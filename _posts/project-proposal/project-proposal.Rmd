# Background
Airbnb, Inc. is one of the most well-known vacation rental platforms in the world. With almost 3 million hosts listing over 7 million accommodations worldwide, airbnb is popular with holidaymakers for the wide availability of rental accommodations.

# Motivation
A common challenge for many hosts is how to price their listing competitively compared to other listings in the same locale. This project aims to provide an application for airbnb hosts to identify whether they their prices are comparative to other accommodations, or too high/low.

# Project Objectives
* Develop an interactive application for end-users
* 

# Proposed Scope and Methodology
This project will focus on Australia as the location of interest.

The methodology that will be used are:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Cluster Analysis
* Text Analytics
* Development of an R-shiny app with interactive features

# Application Features
The application will consist of five main sections, one for each analysis approach.
